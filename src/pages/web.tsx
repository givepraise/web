      Praise is a community intelligence system that promotes active
      participation and collaboration through peer recognition and rewards. We
      help communities become more intelligent, productive and inclusive by
      providing a simple way for community members to acknowledge, praise and
      reward each otherâ€™s contributions.
      <div className="black-section">
        ## How does it work? ``` /praise @vitalik.eth for &quot;inventing
        Ethereum&ldquo; ``` Community members interact with a Discord Praise bot
        to acknowledge each other&apos;s contributions. This bottom-up approach
        to value recognition keeps the community engaged and invested. Praise
        can recognize any contribution, big or small, and even those made
        outside of any platform. This improves cooperation and promotes a more
        positive and productive community.
